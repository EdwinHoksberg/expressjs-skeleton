- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) with preconfigured tasks.
- [Swig](https://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/), a twig templating engine.

# Usage
Before using this framework, execute ```npm install```. This command will load all dependencies.

After that, execute ```gulp install```, to load all libraries in the public folder for you to work with.

If you dont have ```gulp``` installed, execute this command first: ```npm install -g gulp```.
This will install gulp globally, so you can use it on other projects too.

For more information, and the included gulp commands, see [gulpfile.js](gulpfile.js).
